### 🚀 About Me

I'm an **AI/ML Engineer** passionate about building intelligent assistants, especially for underrepresented languages like **Kumaoni** 🗣️.  
My work focuses on:

- 🧠 Fine-tuning **LLMs** (e.g. Phi-2, Qwen2) on custom conversational datasets  
- 🔗 Integrating **RAG + LangChain** for real-time factual assistants  
- 🎙️ Building voice-based AI using **Whisper**, **TTS**, and lightweight models  
- 🌐 Promoting Kumaoni through culturally grounded multilingual AI systems

### 🌱 Currently Working On

- `Pahadi-Bot-Kumaoni`: A real-time Kumaoni voice assistant with RAG and LLMs  
- `Prompt Quality Evaluator`: A bilingual (Hindi–English) tool for evaluating LLM prompts and responses  
- High-quality English–Kumaoni dataset creation (includes audio + speaker metadata)  
- Fine-tuning compact LLMs using QLoRA and LoRA for efficient deployment
