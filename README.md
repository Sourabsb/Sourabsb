### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Sourab Singh Bora, an AI/ML engineer from Uttarakhand 🇮🇳.
I enjoy exploring how language and intelligence can come together to create tools that truly help people — especially those in low-resource or regional communities.

I like working on practical, end-to-end AI systems — not just training models, but also deploying them, evaluating them, and making them speak your language.
When I'm not coding, I’m usually thinking about how to make tech more accessible to people who don’t speak English.

### 🔧 What I'm Working On

- 🤖 Building a unified AI assistant that understands **Kumaoni**, **Hindi**, and **English**, capable of both text and voice interaction.
- 📚 Using **LangChain**, **Whisper**, **FAISS**, and **LoRA** to create grounded, memory-aware assistants with real-time factual updates.
- 💬 Fine-tuning small LLMs like **Phi-2**, **Qwen**, and **GPT-2** for conversational performance on custom datasets.
- 🧠 Making AI systems that not only generate responses — but also reason, decide, and self-correct.

### 🌍 Language Dataset Contributions

- 🗂️ Created a custom **Kumaoni language dataset** featuring:

  - Gender tags for TTS clarity
- 🔄 Also released a **9500+ entry translation dataset**:
  - High-quality sentence pairs: **English ⇄ Kumaoni**
  - Suitable for translators, alignment models, and fine-tuning
